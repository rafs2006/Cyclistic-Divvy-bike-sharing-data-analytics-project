# Cyclistic-Divvy-bike-sharing-data-analytics-project
A capstone project for Google Data Analytics Certificate

Goal: Analyze the Cyclistic historical bike trip data 
to identify trends in how annual members and casual riders differ, 
why casual riders would buy a membership, 
and how digital media could affect the company's marketing tactics.
 
• Explored the bike-sharing trip data, 
using BigQuery, SQL, and R. Generated three hypotheses why casual riders wouldn't want to get a membership.

• Performed data cleaning of 8 million observations with R programming and filled missing values.
Created visualizations for different customer segments for further analysis with ggplot.

• Created combined visualizations for 2020-2021 in Tableau 
and listed the top used bike stations for future targeting ad campaigns.

• Analysed the trends and featured a set of recommendations to overcome the anticipated issues in the Kaggle notebook.

• Filed the presentation with data-driven insights 
involving pricing plans changes and customer journey map towards an annual membership.
